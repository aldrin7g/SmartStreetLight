## 🧠 Why This Project?

Traditional street lighting systems consume excessive energy and require manual fault detection. This smart system addresses:
- Energy efficiency using solar/grid hybrid power
- Real-time fault monitoring and anomaly detection
- Automated brightness control based on environmental lighting
- AI-driven dynamic control based on traffic density
- Quick emergency response with SOS functionality
